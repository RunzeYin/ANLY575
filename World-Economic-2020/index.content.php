<p>In order to understand the economic development status of different country groups in 2020, this website shows some data from The World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. </p>

<p>By looking at the gaps in data between different groups of countries divided according to economic strength or geographic regions, we can get an idea of the level of imbalance in global economic development.</p>

<p>By observing the data, we can tell that in terms of GDP, G7 and emerging and developing Asia are the two largest economies in the world today. But although emerging and developing Asia is composed of 30 countries, their GDP is still much lower than that of G7, which is composed of only 7 countries. In 2020, G7 experienced a steep decrease in exports and middle east and central Asia experienced a steep decrease in imports. In advanced economies, Euro area has the highest unemployment rate.</p>
